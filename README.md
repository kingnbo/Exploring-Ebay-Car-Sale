# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sale
In this repository I explore the prediction of price for a car with data from ebay
The code has two parts where the data is cleaned then I run a nearest neighbor to train a pricing model
The model is only mildly optimized for RMSE error minimization by comparing 2,3 and 4 best features models.
A later improvement for this code would be to optimized the training methodology by using k-folds method instead of a simple training/predict method.

HAVE FUN!
